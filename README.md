# Project Owl

Website:  https://project-owl-ruby-17-zany-wolverine.mybluemix.net/

Manage large and small disasters with the Owl incident management system.  Owl is designed to offer a fast, simple incident management experience --- just by talking to it.

Project Owl is a Ruby on Rails web application hosted on IBM Cloud leveraging the IBM Watson Studio, IBM Watson Cloud APIs, Weather Company APIs, Google Maps API, and public data sets.

## Open Source Software

As a developer, you can build experiences for Owl Software.  These experiences are accessible from the conversational interface.  As an example, our "Weather Experience" is an app-like software that can be built to run on Owl.

## Open Source Hardware

Deploy Owl incident management to geographies without active communications or infrastructure through the ClusterDuck Mobile Network.  This network is made of portable IoT WiFi devices - called "Ducks" - that provide an ad-hoc internet solution.
