# Project Owl

Manage large and small disasters with the Owl incident management system.  Access the website here:  https://project-owl-ruby-17-zany-wolverine.mybluemix.net/

This project is created as a Ruby on Rails web application hosted on IBM Cloud leveraging the IBM Watson Studio, IBM Watson Cloud APIs, Weather Company APIs, Google Maps API, and various public data sets.

Owl is designed to offer a fast, simple incident management experience --- just by talking to it.  

## Open Source Software

As a developer, you can build experiences for Owl Software.  These experiences are accessible from the conversational interface.  As an example, our "Weather Experience" is an app-like software that can be built to run on Owl.
