# ClusterDuck Overview
Hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other events will continue to test the strength of the infrastructure modern society relies on, such as communication equipment like cellular networks.

Communications infrastructure needs to be restored within **72 hours** after which the survival chances of victims decrease drastically. 

Our IoT hardware solution ClusterDuck addresses this issue. Ducks are miniaturized multi-terrain wifi-enabled devices that are dispersed in Clusters in areas where traditional infrastructure and communications is offline. Once dispersed, the Ducks create an ad-hoc wireless network, enabling civilians in need of aid to connect to the network, and send information about their situation, location, and needs.

## The DuckLink

A DuckLink, or simply a "Duck", is a small WiFi-enabled IoT device in a 3D printend enclosure. A DuckLink can connect through WiFi to consumer electronics such as a phone or a laptop. DuckLinks connect to MamaDuck (the central server IoT device) to create a ClusterDuck network.

## DuckLink Range

The DuckLink is the base unit of a ClusterDuck network. One DuckLink is an IoT WiFi device that wirelessly connects to consumer electronics.

## The MamaDuck

The MamaDuck is the central hub of the ClusterDuck network. A single MamaDuck is an IoT LoRa device that connects to DuckLinks over long range.
