# ClusterDuck Overview
### Problem
Hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other events will continue to test the strength of the infrastructure modern society relies on, such as communication equipment like cellular networks.

Communications infrastructure needs to be restored within **72 hours** after which the survival chances of victims decrease drastically. 

### Solution
Our IoT hardware solution `ClusterDuck` addresses this issue. `Ducks` are miniaturized multi-terrain wifi-enabled devices that are dispersed in **Clusters** in areas where traditional infrastructure and communications is offline.

Once dispersed, the Ducks create an ad-hoc wireless network, enabling civilians in need of aid to connect to the network, and send information about their situation, location, and needs.

## The DuckLink

A `DuckLink`, or simply a `Duck`, is a small WiFi-enabled IoT device in a 3D printend enclosure. A `DuckLink` can connect through WiFi to consumer electronics such as a phone or a laptop. `DuckLinks` connect to `MamaDuck` (the central server IoT device) to create a `ClusterDuck` network.

The `Ducks` are weatherproof and multi-terrain. They are floatable and can be deployed as buoys or even tethered to buildings or tall structures. The geodesic design was inspired by old school **radomes** (radar domes) - enclosures to protect radar antennas.

### DuckLink Portal - Quick Native Experience without downloading App or Visiting Link
The `DuckLinks` automatically provide an intuitive emergency captive portal for civilians upon connecting to the hotspot network. This allows the civilians to send immediate requests to the responders.

These portals run on a local server within the `Ducks`. This is highly strategic, as the civilians won't have the internet capability to neither download apps nor visit websites.

## DuckLink Range

The `DuckLink` is the base unit of a `ClusterDuck` network. One `DuckLink` is an IoT WiFi device that wirelessly connects to consumer electronics.

## The MamaDuck

The `MamaDuck` is the central hub of the `ClusterDuck` network. A single `MamaDuck` is an IoT LoRa device that connects to `DuckLinks` over long range.

The `ClusterDuck` is the complete network generated by a `MamaDuck` and her `DuckLinks`.

## QuackPack
#### Open Source Hardware
The `ClusterDuck` hardware solution would also allow passionate developers and OEMs to build on top of our hardware, via lego-like modules called **QuackPacks**. In addition to relaying civilian data, additional `Quacks` would allow `Ducks` to send additional useful and crucial data via sensors such as, **temperature**, **water-pressure**, **smoke**, **gas**, and a lot more!

**QuackHackers** will be provided with boilerplate libraries in order for your `QuackPacks` to work with our `Ducks`.
